            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>
               "I was born on 01.09.2002 in Frauenfeld (Canton of Thurgau, Switzerland). Since I went to an English-speaking kindergarten, I learned the language relatively early. Besides English and my mother tongue German I can also speak Chinese (Mandarin). This, because my father himself comes from Beijing.

            <p>
               At the age of 9 I moved from the canton of Thurgau to the canton of Lucerne. After 6 years of primary school I went to high school and after changing schools several times, I decided to go to a multimedia school, where I learned how to use the camera and how to edit films and photos. After 3.5 years at this school, I am now continuing my education as a mediamatician.
