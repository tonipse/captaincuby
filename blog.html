               Tonight I continued writing the screenplay for the untitled series. The story is shaping up wonderfully. Not only is it well thought out, but the story has a clear thread running through it. I also created a character-board today and looked at the characteristics of the different characters.

            <p>Tonight I continued writing the script for the untitled series, for which shooting is planned for October 2020. Among other things, I drew the first concept art and did a lot of research to integrate my ideas into the script. The script should be finished in about July. - Stay tuned.</p>

               Tonight I started writing a screenplay for an untitled series. The series is supposed to be a live-action series, for which I am currently planning about 3 seasons. (Per season 8-10 episodes). I've made the first drafts and now I'm working on a mind map to collect, filter and finally integrate my ideas into the project.
