               I made my first "movie" when I was nine. The idea of writing a story and telling it as a video fascinated me.
               <br /><br />
               That's why I have already participated in several film competitions and have been nominated several times. The last nomination was in September 2019, when I participated in the ZFF72.
               <br /><br />
               Even today I still deal with filmmaking and plan various projects which should become reality in the near future.
